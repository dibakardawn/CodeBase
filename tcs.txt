Dear Harish, 

Thanks for all your help and support on this. I am glad that I was finally given the platform to voice my concerns. 

I have thought through the two options provided to me at this stage, however, after a lot of deliberation, I have decided not to go ahead with either of them. 

As I mentioned previously, I have trusted and spent a significant time of my career in the account, with not so favourable outcomes, I am not inclined to get into another new arrangement. This may be counterproductive for my growth, but I am willing to take that risk. 

On similar lines, I do not wish to continue in a separate domain. My commitment for the project has run its course, and I do not wish to repeat this ordeal, all over again. I hope you understand. 

The only possible outcome I am after is to smoothly transition out of the account with the right level of technical support and handover. 

If you want to facilitate another discussion, I am happy to do so and prepare a transition plan, if required. 

Thank you.
