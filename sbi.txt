Subject : #Fraud Card # Fraud Billing at Mail & SMS #Need Source of information 

Hi SBI Customer Care,
I have deactivated my SBI Platinum Credit card at 2014. Now at 2019, I am getting mails from SBI credit card every month, 
saying I am holding a credit card xxxx xxxx xxxx xx95 and I have to pay the bills for this Imaginary credit card. 
I am getting the same via SMS as well. Now Please provide me the reason why SBI sending me the imaginary bills now?

Tell me how one deactivated card switched to active, without any reason or permission, after 3 years?

I have got 2 mails from statements@sbicard.com, on 8th May 2019 & 8th June 2019, PDF attached as bill of that imaginary 
credit card (xxxx xxxx xxxx xx95). The bill pdfs are password protected and can be opened entering the card number as password. 
But I was surprised when I see my old card (Deactivated at 2014) number is different from the card number mentioned in the mail, 
and bill pdfs are not opening by the my old card(deactivated at 2014) number.

Tell me how xxxx xxxx xxxx xx95 this card tagged with me, my old deactivated card was xxxx xxxx xxxx xx50 and that is valid up to 02/2021. 
How a new imaginary card can be tagged with me without my permission?

I have got 3 SMS at my number 9681090303, on 9th April 2019, 9th May 2019 & 9th June 2019, Saying to pay the bills 311/-, 323/- & 455/- accordingly.
I have never used that card, tell me one valid reason to pay this money.

Stop sending fraud mails & nonsense sms. 

No company can grow with fraud products and nonsense associates.
